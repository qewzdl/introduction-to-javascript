                <h3 class="block-title">1. Creation and Initial Development</h3>
                <p class="block-description">JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich, who developed it in just 10 days for Netscape.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block" id="block-2">
                <h3 class="block-title">2. Name Evolution</h3>
                <p class="block-description">Initially named Mocha, it was later renamed LiveScript and then JavaScript as a marketing strategy to associate it with the popular Java language at the time.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block" id="block-3">
                <h3 class="block-title">3. Original Purpose</h3>
                <p class="block-description">Originally designed for adding simple interactive features to web pages, JavaScript quickly became a cornerstone of web development.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block" id="block-4">
                <h3 class="block-title">4. Standardization</h3>
                <p class="block-description">In 1997, it was standardized by ECMA under the name ECMAScript (ES).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block" id="block-5">
                <h3 class="block-title">5. Modern Evolution</h3>
                <p class="block-description">Since then, the language has evolved significantly, with major updates like ES6 (2015) introducing modern features such as classes, modules, and arrow functions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="block" id="block-6">
                <h3 class="block-title">6. Current Use</h3>
                <p class="block-description">Today, JavaScript is a versatile tool used for building both client-side and server-side applications, making it essential for modern web development.</p>

        <h2 class="container-title">Interpreted and Compiled Languages</h2>

        <div class="container-1">
            <h3 id="interpreted-text">Interpreted languages</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>In such languages, the code is executed line by line by an interpreter. The program is not pre-translated into machine code; instead, the interpreter reads and executes instructions on the fly. This allows the code to run immediately but can be slower due to line-by-line execution.</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <div class="examples">
                <p class="example">Python</p>
                <p class="example">PHP</p>
                <p class="example">Ruby</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container-1">
            <h3 id="compiled-text">Compiled languages</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>In compiled languages, the code is translated into machine code before execution. This process creates an executable file that is then run on the device. Compilation may take time, but the resulting code is usually faster as it is optimized for a specific platform.</p>
            <h4>Examples:</h4>
            <div class="examples">
                <p class="example">C</p>
                <p class="example">C++</p>
                <p class="example">Rust</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container-1">
            <h3 id="compiled-text">JavaScript</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>JavaScript is primarily an interpreted language, but its execution is often accelerated through JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation. Modern engines (such as V8 or SpiderMonkey) first interpret the code and then compile frequently used parts into machine code, improving performance. This makes JS a hybrid between interpretation and compilation.</p>
